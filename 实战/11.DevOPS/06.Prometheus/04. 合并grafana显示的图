1. Merge Multiple Queries per Table
    In its simplest case, both queries return time-series data with a numeric value and a timestamp. If the timestamps are the same, datapoints will be matched and rendered on the same row. Some datasources return keys and values (labels, tags) associated with the datapoint. These are being matched as well if they are present in both results and have the same value. The following datapoints will end up on the same row with one time column, two label columns (“host” and “job”) and two value columns:

    Datapoint for query A: {time: 1, host: "node-2", job: "job-8", value: 3}
    Datapoint for query B: {time: 1, host: "node-2", value: 4}
    The following two results cannot be matched and will be rendered on separate rows:

    Different time
    Datapoint for query A: {time: 1, host: "node-2", job: "job-8", value: 3}
    Datapoint for query B: {time: 2, host: "node-2", value: 4}

    Different label "host"
    Datapoint for query A: {time: 1, host: "node-2", job: "job-8", value: 3}
    Datapoint for query B: {time: 1, host: "node-9", value: 4}

2. 合并指标
sum by (instance,job) (sort_desc(store_scale_sftp_status_work_onoff{type="SFTP_STATUS"}))
或者
sum(sort_desc(store_scale_sftp_status_work_onoff{type="SFTP_STATUS"})) by (instance,job)
